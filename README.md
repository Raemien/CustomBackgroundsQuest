# Custom Backgrounds
Import any 360 image file into Beat Saber and use it as a skybox!

Background images are stored in the 'ModData\com.beatgames.beatsaber\Mods\CustomBackgrounds' directory.
## Guide - Background Creation
Want to create your own background packs?
Follow the setup used in [this example pack](https://raemien.com/bsmodding/BackgroundPackExample.zip).

Although any image will *technically* work using this mod, an equirectangular texture is recommended if you're looking to import a 360 image/skybox.
In layman's terms, you'll need an image formatted to wrap around a sphere for it to display correctly in-game.

If you're looking to snap your own 360 photos, the Street View app allows you to export images which can be used natively by this mod.
